 * steps -- no boost stage, no DAC/detector fields (they don't exist in
 * vtx_power_level_t on this build).
 *
 * Level NUMBERS are 1-based (see vtx_power_levels.h) but this array is
 * plain 0-based -- level N is entry [N-1] below, there is no reserved
 * slot 0. No EEPROM overlay on this board (nothing to calibrate), so
 * this stays a plain target-fixed const, unlike the USE_PA targets.
 *
 * mW figures are rough/unverified -- RTC6705's own output varies by
 * board layout and matching network. Treat as a starting point, not a
 * calibrated fact.
